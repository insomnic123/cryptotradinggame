## 🎮 Game Overview
CRiDO is an interactive tycoon-style game where you mine cryptocurrency, convert it into cash, trade stocks, and grow your net worth. Inspired by classics like Cookie Clicker and also a Summer of Making project called <a href="https://cryptotycoon.vercel.app/">defi Empire - Web3 Tycoon </a>(I could not find the OG maker :(( ), CRiDO lets players upgrade systems, build a trading team, and experiment with market mechanics, all in a playful, fun environment.
